Configuring CI for .Net Core using Travis CI and Xunit

to configure your .travis.yml file. For a basic CI pipeline, running your .Net Core tests on a linux box you really donâ€™t need much:

language: csharp
dist: trusty
mono: none
dotnet: 1.0.1
install:
- dotnet restore
script:
- dotnet build
- dotnet test Core.Shogi.Tests/Core.Shogi.Tests.csproj


 all the paths are relative to the root of your repository, therefore save your .travis.yml there are well.
Also that I have not provided a solution name. That alongside having mono not to be installed made the builds be
executed twice as fast as they first were.
